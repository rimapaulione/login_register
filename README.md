# Login - register form

<p>This application is an educational project developed using Next.js and the beta version of NextAuth.js 5. The primary goal of this project is to explore the integration of NextAuth with a real database and a Spring Boot REST API. It focuses on implementing a custom authentication flow, including registration and login forms, using credentials.

The project demonstrates how to:

- Create a user-friendly registration and login system.
- Integrate NextAuth.js to securely handle authentication with a Spring Boot API.
- Fetch and verify tokens from the API to authenticate users.
- Ensure email verification as a prerequisite for signing in.
